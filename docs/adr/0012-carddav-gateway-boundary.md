# ADR 0012: CardDAV Gateway Boundary

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Calendar attendees, organizer resolution, shared address books, webmail
auto-complete, mobile sync, and future CardDAV clients need a standards-shaped
contacts boundary. Directory owns platform principals and organization
relationships; Contacts/CardDAV must own user address books, personal/external
people, and vCard resources.

Building contacts as generic CRUD first would repeat the CalDAV risk: product
APIs could drift away from WebDAV/CardDAV semantics before native clients are
supported.

## Decision

Create `internal/carddavgw` as the CardDAV/WebDAV protocol boundary. The first
slice owns RFC names, DAV capability tokens, principal paths, address-book home
paths, address-book collection paths, `.vcf` contact-object resource paths, and
safe relative/absolute href parsing.

Storage, vCard parsing, REPORT handling, sync tokens, auth, and HTTP listener
wiring will be added only when their semantics are implemented and tested.

## Consequences

- Contacts/CardDAV can evolve as a standards-first module instead of a webmail
  CRUD side table.
- Future CalDAV attendee and resource lookup can depend on Directory plus
  Contacts/CardDAV without inventing private person models.
- Public CardDAV compatibility remains out of scope until vCard validation,
  address-book storage, REPORT behavior, sync, auth, and native-client tests
  are implemented.
