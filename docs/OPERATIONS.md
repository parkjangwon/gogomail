# Operations Runbook

Day-2 operations for gogomail: health, metrics, alerts, shutdown, backup,
migration, and incident response.

## Health check endpoints

HTTP modes (`mail-api`, `admin-api`, `auth-server`, `all-in-one`):

| Path | Purpose | LB usage |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health/live` | Process responsive (no deps probed) | k8s liveness |
| `GET /health/ready` | Postgres + Redis reachable | k8s readiness + LB |

Both return `200` with JSON `{"status":"ok",...}` on success. `/health/ready`
returns `503` when DB ping fails or Redis is unreachable.

Non-HTTP modes (SMTP/IMAP/POP3/LDAP) — use TCP listen probe on the bound
port. There is no protocol-level health URI. For deep probing run a periodic
synthetic SMTP HELO or IMAP LOGIN with a monitoring account.

Workers — no HTTP server by default. Add `GOGOMAIL_METRICS_ADDR=:9090` to
expose Prometheus metrics (which doubles as a TCP liveness probe target).

---

## Prometheus metrics

Enabled when `GOGOMAIL_METRICS_BACKEND=prometheus` and `GOGOMAIL_METRICS_ADDR`
is set (e.g. `:9090`). Endpoint: `GET /metrics`.

---

## Centralized logging

Production modes write structured slog JSON to stdout. Development keeps text
logs for readability, but uses the same fields and redaction rules. Ship stdout
from every Go mode and both Next.js apps to ELK, Loki/Grafana, or another log
drain.

Common fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `request_id` | Primary correlation id. HTTP accepts `X-Request-ID`, generates one when missing, returns it in `X-Request-ID`, and forwards it through the webmail/admin Next.js proxies to the Go APIs. |
| `component` | Runtime surface such as `next-api`, `smtp`, `delivery`, or `ldap`. |
| `protocol` | Protocol family for non-HTTP logs, e.g. `smtp`, `smtp-delivery`, `ldap`. |
| `method`, `route`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `bytes` | HTTP access-log fields. Routes are normalized to avoid high-cardinality ids. |
| `user_id`, `actor_id`, `company_id`, `tenant_id`, `domain_id` | Authenticated context when available. |
| `message_id`, `rfc_message_id`, `recipient_count` | Mail-flow correlation fields for delivery logs. |

HTTP access logs are emitted in English as `http request`. They never include
request or response bodies. Sensitive attributes such as authorization headers,
cookies, passwords, tokens, secrets, and API/private keys are redacted before
they reach the handler.

Protocol and worker logs:

- SMTP receive/submission and delivery worker events flow through the
  observability adapter. Set `GOGOMAIL_METRICS_BACKEND=slog` to emit those
  mail-flow events as structured logs, or `prometheus` to emit metrics.
- LDAP gateway events use the same adapter and include `request_id`, operation,
  result, result code, remote address, and entry count.
- IMAP, POP3, CalDAV, CardDAV, and WebDAV HTTP gateway requests are covered by
  the HTTP access log when served through the Go HTTP stack. TCP-only protocol
  connection gauges remain in Prometheus.
- The webmail and admin console server-side API routes log one structured JSON
  line per proxied backend request and forward `X-Request-ID` to the backend.
- Best-effort cleanup and rollback paths are no longer silent. Attachment
  upload finalization, Drive object copy/stage rollback, SMTP receive and
  submission rollback, IMAP APPEND metadata rollback, outbound-send object
  rollback, DSN queue rollback, API usage export artifact rollback, and storage
  readiness cleanup log warning records when compensating deletes fail. Drive
  workflows also persist cleanup failure records where a recorder is available.
- SCIM soft-delete/deactivate/active synchronization logs warning records when
  external IdP `UpdateUserStatus` calls fail, including operation, user id,
  desired status, and error.
- Fail-open API metering sink errors emit warning logs with request route,
  method, status, and user context while preserving request availability.
- `cmd/remote-signer` writes structured JSON logs, validates config at startup,
  enforces HTTP read/header/write/idle timeouts and max-header size, and shuts
  down gracefully on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

Suggested Kibana/Loki pivots:

```text
request_id="req-..."                         # one browser/API/proxy/backend trace
component="delivery" message_id="..."        # one outbound delivery flow
protocol="smtp" remote_addr="203.0.113.10"   # SMTP behavior from one peer
status>=500 route="/api/v1/messages/{id}"    # normalized API failures
level="WARN" cleanup                         # cleanup/rollback failures
level="WARN" UpdateUserStatus                # SCIM external IdP sync drift
```

## Recommended alerts

Starter rules in `docker/alert-rules.yml`. Tune thresholds per traffic.

```yaml
groups:
- name: gogomail-critical
  rules:
  - alert: HighHTTPErrorRate
    expr: |
      sum by (route) (rate(gogomail_http_request_duration_seconds_count{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
        / sum by (route) (rate(gogomail_http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])) > 0.05
    for: 10m
    annotations:
      summary: ">5% 5xx on {{ $labels.route }}"

  - alert: OutboxLagHigh
    expr: gogomail_outbox_lag_seconds > 300
    for: 5m
    annotations:
      summary: "Outbox relay lag > 5m — delivery delayed"

  - alert: StreamLagHigh
    expr: gogomail_redis_stream_lag_seconds > 60
    for: 10m
    annotations:
      summary: "{{ $labels.stream }} consumer lag > 60s"

  - alert: DLQGrowing
    expr: rate(gogomail_redis_stream_dlq_total[10m]) > 0
    for: 15m
    annotations:
      summary: "{{ $labels.stream }} dead-lettering events"

  - alert: DBConnectionPoolExhausted
    expr: gogomail_db_pool_in_use / gogomail_db_pool_open > 0.9
    for: 5m

  - alert: SMTPAuthFailureSpike
    expr: rate(gogomail_auth_failures_total{protocol="smtp"}[5m]) > 50
    for: 5m
    annotations:
      summary: "Possible credential-stuffing on submission"

  - alert: DeliveryCircuitOpen
    expr: gogomail_delivery_circuit_state == 1
    for: 15m
    annotations:
      summary: "Delivery to {{ $labels.domain }} circuit open >15m"

  - alert: BackpressureCritical
    expr: gogomail_backpressure_state == 3
    for: 2m
    annotations:
      summary: "Backpressure CRITICAL — rejecting SMTP"

- name: gogomail-warning
  rules:
  - alert: ReplicationLagHigh
    # check on the Postgres exporter, not on gogomail metrics
    expr: pg_replication_lag_seconds > 30
    for: 10m

  - alert: AttachmentScanFailures
    expr: rate(gogomail_attachment_scan_total{verdict="error"}[10m]) > 1
    for: 15m
```

Add log-derived alerts in Loki or the log pipeline for:

- cleanup/rollback delete warnings, especially repeated warnings for the same
  storage backend or object prefix
- SCIM `UpdateUserStatus` warning logs, because external IdP drift is
  operator-visible state
- API metering sink warning logs, which indicate usage evidence is fail-open
  but delayed or incomplete
- remote signer startup/shutdown errors or request timeout spikes before
  invoice-grade API usage export handoff

---

## Graceful shutdown sequence

On SIGTERM/SIGINT, gogomail enters a 30-second drain window
(`context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)` — see
`internal/app/run.go:689`, 749, 810, 3101, 3464).

Per-mode behavior:

| Mode | Drain behavior |
|---|---|
| HTTP modes | `Server.Shutdown(ctx)` — stop accepting; finish in-flight; close idle |
| SMTP modes | Stop `Accept()`; existing sessions get reply 421 on next command after timeout |
| IMAP / POP3 / DAV / LDAP | Stop `Accept()`; existing sessions allowed to finish current command, then forcefully closed at 30s |
| Stream-consumer workers | Stop `XREADGROUP`; finish in-flight handler; `XACK` everything claimed; release consumer-group lease |
| Singleton workers | Finish current iteration; release advisory lock |
| `outbox-relay` | Finish current batch; release lock; standby takes over within ~5s |

**Operator action**: set k8s `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 45` (30s app drain
+ 15s buffer) and PreStop `sleep 5` to let LB drain first.

---

## Migration runbook (zero-downtime)

Migrations are forward-only SQL in `migrations/`.

```bash
# 1. Pre-flight: ensure new schema is backward-compatible with running code
#    (no DROP/RENAME of columns still referenced)

# 2. Run migrations against primary
gogomail -migrate -mode all-in-one  # exits after migrations

# 3. Rolling-restart app/worker replicas
kubectl rollout restart deployment/gogomail-app
kubectl rollout restart deployment/gogomail-worker

# 4. Verify
kubectl rollout status deployment/gogomail-app --timeout=5m
```

Rules:
- **Additive only** during traffic-up window: new tables, new nullable
  columns, new indexes (`CONCURRENTLY`).
- **Destructive** changes (DROP, NOT NULL on populated column, type change)
  go in a follow-up release after the field is unreferenced.
- Long-running index builds: always `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
- Backfills: chunked in `batch-worker` or a one-shot script, not the
  migration itself.

## Backup & restore

### Postgres

```bash
# Daily logical
pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-acl \
  --file=gogomail-$(date +%F).dump "$DATABASE_URL"

# Continuous WAL archive (preferred for RPO < 1m)
# Use managed RDS / Patroni / pgBackRest
```

Recovery:
```bash
createdb gogomail
pg_restore --dbname=gogomail --no-owner --no-acl gogomail-2026-05-23.dump
```

Test the restore quarterly into a scratch namespace.

### Object storage

- S3: enable **versioning** + **lifecycle to delete versions > 90d**.
- MinIO: enable site replication.
- Verify monthly with a sample restore (download a known object from a prior
  version).

### Redis

Redis state is **ephemeral** for gogomail — streams + rate-limit counters.
Recovery: bring up a fresh Redis; `outbox-relay` re-publishes any events that
were not yet acknowledged. AOF is recommended for `delivery.event` to
minimize re-delivery.

---

## Common failure scenarios

### Outbox lag growing

**Symptom** — `gogomail_outbox_lag_seconds` > 300; outbound mail delayed.

**Diagnose** —
1. Is `outbox-relay` running? `kubectl logs deploy/outbox-relay`.
2. Holding the advisory lock? `SELECT pg_locks.* FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype='advisory'`.
3. Redis stream backed up? `XLEN delivery.event`.

**Fix** —
- If relay is OOM-looping: increase memory.
- If Redis is saturated: scale Redis, increase
  `DELIVERY_CONSUMER_COUNT`.
- If PG is the bottleneck: check `pg_stat_activity` for blocking queries.

### Delivery stuck on a single remote domain

**Symptom** — `gogomail_delivery_circuit_state{domain=...}` == 1 for hours.

**Fix** — Confirm the remote MX is broken; the circuit will auto half-open
after `GOGOMAIL_DELIVERY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT`. Force-close by reducing
the timeout temporarily, or pause the worker and re-queue.

### IMAP gateway CPU/memory exhaustion

**Symptom** — `gogomail_imap_active_connections` near
`IMAP_MAX_CONNECTIONS`; replicas OOM.

**Fix** — Scale IMAP replicas; reduce
`GOGOMAIL_IMAP_NOTIFY_CONSUMER_COUNT` per replica; tighten
`IMAP_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

### Brute-force on SMTP submission

**Symptom** — `rate(gogomail_auth_failures_total{protocol="smtp"}[5m]) > 50`.

**Fix** — `authFailureTracker` already throttles per-IP. If sustained, add an
upstream firewall rule. Check `audit_log` for the targeted accounts and
force-reset their passwords.

### Database connection exhausted

**Symptom** — `gogomail_db_pool_in_use / gogomail_db_pool_open > 0.9`;
HTTP 503s.

**Fix** — Increase `GOGOMAIL_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` if PG has headroom; otherwise
scale PG vertically or add PgBouncer (transaction-pooling) in front. Check
for runaway queries with `pg_stat_activity`.

### Replication lag (PG)

**Symptom** — Stale reads, `pg_replication_lag_seconds` > 30.

**Fix** — Reduce write rate (throttle workers temporarily); check WAL disk
saturation; verify replica is not running heavy ad-hoc queries.

### JWT secret leaked

**Procedure** —
1. Generate new 32-byte secret.
2. Deploy app with `GOGOMAIL_AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<new>` and
   `GOGOMAIL_AUTH_JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS=<old>` (accepted for verify only).
3. Force token rotation via admin endpoint (revokes all refresh families).
4. After max refresh-token TTL elapses, remove the previous secret.

## Capacity planning rules of thumb

These are starting points — measure your workload.

| Resource | Per ... | Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| `mail-api` CPU | 1k active users | 0.5 vCPU |
| `mail-api` RAM | 1k active users | 500 MB |
| `imap` CPU | 1k connected clients | 0.5 vCPU |
| `imap` RAM | 1k connected clients | 800 MB (idle buffer + parser state) |
| `edge-mta` CPU | 100 sessions/sec | 1 vCPU |
| `edge-mta` RAM | 1000 concurrent sessions | 1 GB |
| `delivery-worker` CPU | 100 deliveries/sec | 1 vCPU |
| `outbox-relay` CPU | 10k events/sec | 1 vCPU (singleton; vertical scale only) |
| `search-index-worker` CPU | 1k indexed docs/sec | 1 vCPU |
| Postgres CPU | 1k active mailboxes | 0.5 vCPU |
| Postgres RAM | 1k mailboxes | 1 GB (shared_buffers heuristic) |
| Postgres storage | 1 user-year of mail | ~5 GB metadata (bodies in S3) |
| Redis RAM | 10k connected IMAP clients | 200 MB (state + streams) |
| Object storage | 1k users avg mailbox | ~5 GB/user typical |

Validation tests should drive numbers — run `scripts/load-test.sh` against a
staging environment before committing to a sizing.

## Routine maintenance schedule

| Cadence | Action |
|---|---|
| Daily | Verify backup completed; spot-check alert log; review `audit_log` for suspicious admin actions |
| Weekly | Review error-rate trends; check disk usage on PG and storage; sample restore test (rotating) |
| Monthly | Patch base images; rotate non-critical credentials; review capacity vs trend; full DR drill in staging |
| Quarterly | Rotate `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`; rotate DKIM keys; review and prune audit log per policy |
| Annually | Full restore exercise from cold backup; reassess threat model |
