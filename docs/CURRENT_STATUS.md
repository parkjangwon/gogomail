# gogomail current status

Last updated: 2026-05-04 (updated after platform hardening sprint)

## Current phase

gogomail is in the backend platform hardening phase.

The project has moved beyond SMTP-only development. SMTP remains a critical
RFC-sensitive core, but current work should balance:

- tenant/domain operations
- Admin API
- Mail API contracts
- delivery routing and observability
- DNS/DKIM/domain onboarding
- quota and policy enforcement
- OpenAPI drift prevention

Actual Next.js frontend implementation has not started. Before creating or
substantially implementing frontend apps, ask the user for frontend-specific
guidance.

## Completed or materially advanced

- SMTP receive engine with real TCP integration coverage.
- Authenticated Submission MTA with STARTTLS and SMTPS support.
- Outbound SMTP delivery with direct MX, smart-host, TLS policy, retry, and
  partial recipient failure handling.
- DSN/bounce handling with RFC 3461/3464-oriented metadata, null reverse-path,
  `NOTIFY=NEVER`, deterministic outbox dedupe, and loop-risk reduction.
- Shared high-performance-minded EML parsing boundary under `internal/message`.
- PostgreSQL metadata model for companies, domains, users, folders, messages,
  attachments, outbox, audit logs, DKIM keys, trusted relays, delivery routes,
  domain DNS checks, and policy-bearing domain settings.
- Admin APIs for domains, users, quotas, DKIM keys, trusted relays, delivery
  routes, delivery route resolution, queue stats, delivery attempts,
  suppression list, quota usage, domain DNS checks/history, backpressure
  inspection/update, domain policy, per-domain stats, DKIM DNS verification,
  delivery route runtime counters, and exhausted delivery attempts.
- Mail APIs for folders, messages, flags, bulk operations, drafts, send, and
  attachments, thread lists/thread messages, plus user-scoped sent-message
  delivery/bounce status.
- Inbound parsing now extracts RFC `In-Reply-To`/`References`; inbound and
  reply/forward outbound persistence inherit local thread IDs when matching
  source messages exist.
- Reply composition writes RFC `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers into outgoing
  `.eml` messages.
- Mail API exposes a first Postgres-backed search endpoint for message metadata
  and draft text, with an FTS index for small deployments.
- Received-message body search now has an asynchronous indexing boundary:
  `search-index-worker` consumes `mail.stored`, reads stored `.eml` objects,
  extracts bounded text through the shared parser, and upserts Postgres search
  documents used by the existing search endpoint.
- Search responses can now opt into relevance sorting, rank scores, and bounded
  Postgres headline snippets while preserving date-sorted results by default.
- Mail API send/draft-send applies domain outbound policy in enforce mode for
  recipient-count and composed-message-size guardrails.
- Mail API attachment reservation/direct upload applies enforced domain
  `max_attachment_bytes` policy before quota reservation or object storage
  writes.
- Per-domain inbound policy enforced at SMTP receive and Submission MTA (max
  recipients, max message size, inbound mode).
- Hierarchical quota ledger enforced at mail storage write/delete boundaries:
  company, domain, and user usage counters are updated atomically in the same
  PostgreSQL transaction. User quota source is tracked as `default|custom`, and
  domain default user quota updates apply to default-following users while
  preserving custom overrides.
- Attachment upload metadata creation reserves bytes from the same
  company/domain/user quota ledger, stale upload cleanup releases them, and the
  Mail API returns HTTP 507 `insufficient_storage` for quota exhaustion.
- Admin quota views now expose runtime remaining capacity, child-allocation
  usage, allocatable capacity, and over-allocation indicators for
  company/domain/user operations.
- Admin API exposes a read-only quota reconciliation report comparing ledger
  counters with message and attachment source rows.
- Admin API can run operator-controlled quota reconciliation corrections with
  transaction/advisory locking.
- Product quota direction is company pool → domain allocation → user unified
  storage allowance. User quota should cover mailbox, attachments, future Drive,
  and other user-owned storage features.
- API metering direction is agreed for future SaaS operations: collect usage
  dimensions early through an async middleware/event boundary, but keep
  billing/rate-limit enforcement policy-driven and disabled by default.
- API metering has a first disabled-by-default middleware boundary with a
  `slog` sink for low-risk operational visibility and an outbox sink for durable
  `api.usage` event emission.
- API metering now has an aggregation worker boundary: `api-metering-worker`
  consumes `api.usage` events from `api.event`, upserts Postgres daily
  and monthly aggregates, and exposes `GET /admin/v1/api-usage/daily` plus
  `GET /admin/v1/api-usage/monthly` for operations.
- Push notification enqueue now has an async worker boundary:
  `push-notification-worker` consumes `mail.stored` events and can emit
  disabled-by-default `slog` notification candidates without touching SMTP hot
  paths or committing to FCM/APNs SDKs.
- DKIM key DNS verification workflow with `dns_verified_at` persistence.
- Delivery route runtime counters (`RouteCounters`) with Admin API exposure.
- Retry exhaustion hook: `mail.delivery_exhausted` outbox event emitted and
  `delivery_attempts` row with status `exhausted` written when all retries fail.
- DMARC reject policy enforcement at SMTP receive (`DMARCEnforce` flag).
- SMTPUTF8 declared correctly on outbound MAIL FROM for all internationalized
  addresses (RFC 6531 compliance fix).
- OpenAPI draft with route, request body, response envelope, operationId, and
  component reference drift tests.  All schemas kept in sync with Go types.
- Backend release verification script and SMTP release runbook.
- Public GitHub repository:

## Explicitly not started

- Next.js shell/webmail/admin frontend implementation.
- Built-in spam scoring or pattern filtering.
- IMAP/POP3 protocol servers. A dependency-light `internal/imapgw` boundary now
  records native IMAP gateway DTOs, mailbox helpers, and flag semantics.
- OpenSearch indexing.
- Kafka migration.
- etcd/Vault production control plane.
- Vendor push notification delivery adapters and device-token storage.

## Important guardrails

- Implemented SMTP features must strictly follow the relevant email RFCs.
- Do not advertise SMTP extensions until end-to-end semantics are implemented
  and tested.
- Do not turn SMTP core into a spam engine. Spam relay/filtering belongs behind
  explicit hooks/adapters.
- Keep hot paths streaming and allocation-aware.
- Preserve domain-as-tenant isolation.
- Commit by feature and push after completed work.

## Latest direction

The platform hardening sprint completed the following:

- Mailbox quota enforcement (receive, send, delete)
- Per-domain SMTP inbound policy (max recipients, max message size)
- DKIM DNS verification workflow
- Delivery route runtime counters
- Retry exhaustion events and Admin API exposure
- SMTPUTF8 outbound RFC 6531 fix
- DMARC reject policy enforcement hook
- Domain aggregate stats endpoint
- OpenAPI schema expansion (DKIMKey, DeliveryAttempt, DKIMKeyDNSVerification)
- Hierarchical quota ledger first implementation: company/domain/user Admin
  quota APIs, user quota source, domain default user quota propagation, and
  aggregate quota enforcement for mail writes/deletes.
- Attachment upload quota integration: upload metadata reserves quota, stale
  upload cleanup releases quota, and API quota exhaustion maps to 507.
- Search indexing boundary: bounded received body extraction runs in
  `search-index-worker` and stores Postgres search documents outside SMTP hot
  paths.
- Search contract expansion: clients can request `sort=relevance`,
  `include_rank=true`, and `include_highlights=true` without changing the
  default message list shape.
- Quota operations read models: capacity fields and reconciliation reporting
  show ledger pressure and drift without mutating counters.
- Quota correction actions: operators can explicitly apply reconciliation
  results to company/domain/user ledgers after reviewing drift.
- IMAP gateway planning: native backend interfaces and RFC-shaped flag/mailbox
  helpers exist without starting a TCP protocol server.
- Push notification worker boundary: `mail.stored` can be consumed by a
  dedicated notification worker with a replaceable sink.
- API metering boundary: HTTP middleware can emit fail-open usage events to
  logs or the durable outbox, while the disabled-by-default aggregation worker
  can build daily/monthly Postgres read models for operations.
- Attachment policy hardening: domain outbound policy can cap individual
  attachment upload sizes.

Next focus areas:

1. Add OpenSearch adapter behind the search indexing boundary.
2. Extend the quota ledger to future Drive writes and large share-link objects.
3. IMAP UID/UIDVALIDITY/MODSEQ storage design and migrations.
4. Push notification device-token storage and FCM/APNs adapters behind the
   worker sink.
5. Add billing-grade API metering dimensions/idempotency before using
   aggregates for invoices or hard limits.
6. Frontend planning and API contract review before webmail implementation.
