# gogomail backend roadmap

## Phase 0: backend foundation

- Single Go binary: `gogomail --mode=<component>`
- Environment-based config loader
- Liveness/readiness HTTP endpoints
- Mail address normalization utility
- Test-first baseline

## Phase 1: receive and read mail

Target outcome:

> SMTP로 메일을 넣으면 원문이 저장되고, REST API로 메일 목록/상세를 조회할 수 있다.

Shared mail parsing lives in `internal/message` so SMTP, Mail API, future IMAP, and future POP3 use the same RFC 5322/MIME parsing behavior.

SMTP receive exposes explicit pipeline hook stages:

- `backpressure_checked`
- `spooled`
- `parsed`
- `dedup_checked`
- `stored`
- `recorded`

Future modules such as spam relay, image conversion, FCM/push enqueue, audit logging, attachment scanning, and indexing should attach to these explicit stages instead of being hard-coded into the SMTP engine.

SMTP receive policy is explicit and should grow as the receive boundary matures:

- max recipients per message
- max message bytes
- future per-IP/per-domain rate limits
- future queue/backpressure checks

Received mail persistence follows the Outbox Pattern:

- Store `.eml` first through the storage backend.
- Insert `messages` metadata and a `mail.event` / `mail.stored` outbox row in one PostgreSQL transaction.
- `gogomail --mode=outbox-relay` claims pending outbox rows and publishes them to Redis Streams.
- Redis stream consumers route events by payload `event` name so optional modules can plug in their own handlers.
- `gogomail --mode=event-worker` consumes `mail.event` and records `mail.stored` as `mail.received` audit logs.
- Keep indexing, push notifications, audit fan-out, and queue publishing asynchronous consumers of the outbox/event stream.

Implementation order:

1. PostgreSQL migrations for company/domain/user/address/folder/message.
2. Storage backend interface with local and Minio implementations.
3. SMTP receive path using `go-smtp`.
4. Recipient validation against `user_addresses`.
5. `.eml` persistence, shared EML parsing, and `MessageRecorder` metadata handoff.
6. PostgreSQL-backed recorder for `messages` insert.
7. Redis SET NX duplicate detection.
8. PostgreSQL outbox event creation for stored mail.
9. Mail API list/detail/folder endpoints.
10. RFC 5322/MIME outbound text composer and outbound farm classifier.
11. Delivery worker consumes `mail.outbound.general` and hands queued `.eml` messages to a pluggable SMTP transport.
12. Delivery attempts are recorded for delivered/failed recipients as retry and bounce groundwork.
13. Failed delivery attempts can schedule delayed retries through outbox `available_at`.
14. SMTP 4xx/5xx responses are classified so 5xx hard bounces stop retry while temporary failures retry.
15. Hard-bounced recipients are added to suppression list and blocked before future send enqueue.
16. Delivery outcomes emit `mail.delivered`, `mail.bounced`, or `mail.delivery_failed` events for audit and future admin streams.
